Product Requirements Document (PRD) Template



What is a PRD?

A PRD is a living guide written by a Product Manager used to communicate and outline what they are building, who it is for, and how it benefits the end user. It also serves as a guide for business and technical teams to help develop, launch, and market the product.

💂  Guardrails for Issue Detection and Notification

Benefits:

Early Issue Detection: Minimize downtime and user impact by catching issues before they escalate.

Improved Responsiveness: Enable prompt resolution through timely alerts and notifications.

Enhanced Product Reliability: Build trust with users by maintaining a stable and resilient product experience.

Issue Detection Mechanism:

Implement automated monitoring and detection mechanisms to continuously assess the performance and health of the product feature.

Integrate with relevant monitoring tools and platforms to capture real-time data.

Notification System:

Develop a notification system that triggers alerts when a guardrail threshold is breached or an issue is detected.

Ensure notifications are delivered promptly to designated stakeholders via preferred communication channels (e.g., email, Slack).

🪴GTM Approach

What’s the product messaging that your marketing department will use to describe this product to existing and new customers? How do you plan to launch this product to the market with marketing and sales teams?



Note: Link to a larger GTM/RFM plan if available.  (To be taken from Growth/Marketing team)

📭 Open Issues

What factors do you still need to figure out? What problems may arise and how do you plan on addressing them? 

⁉️Q&A

What are common questions about the product along with the answers you’ve decided? This is a good place to note key decisions.
