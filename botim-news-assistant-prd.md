# Botim News Assistant - One Pager

## 🌟 Overview

Botim News Assistant is an AI-driven news service designed to provide high-quality news content to Botim users. This feature allows users to receive personalized news recommendations and perform AI-powered searches for relevant content. Its core goal is to enrich the Botim ecosystem, enhance user retention, and generate revenue through advertisements. The news assistant recommends trending content based on users' geographical location, language, and other profile attributes. News is sourced from GPT's web search and formatted to include a title, subtitle, details, AI-generated related questions, and hashtags.

## 🚀 Problem

Currently, Botim lacks a content service, leading to high user churn after completing calls or chats, as users have no reason to stay in the app. Many users have a demand for news, but Botim does not currently fulfill this need. Traditional news services often face copyright issues and high maintenance costs, whereas AI-generated news content can reduce operational expenses and mitigate copyright risks.

- **Enable Advertisement Monetization** – Leveraging precise ad placements to drive revenue and offset AI operational costs.

## 🚧 Constraints

- **Engineering Resources** – Requires AI search optimization to ensure precise and performant content recommendations.
- **Privacy Compliance** – Must adhere to privacy regulations when utilizing users' geographical and language data.
